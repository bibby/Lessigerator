A Lessig Method presentation slideware object in Javascript.
The purpose being to rapidly create and edit a presentation.

A basic demo @ http://bbby.org/Lessig

I added this repo to share with friends and everyone else. 
It is not my intention to suggest that this project is "finished" in any sense of the word. 
In fact, it was just written and more or less just starting working well.

Things I'd like to do:
- have Line styles not need much (or any html)
- possibly Line partials for emphasized words (easier that &lt;em&gt;?)
- slide display effects,  ( typing, puff?)
- (small!) css class library
